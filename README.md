# Editing Workflow

1. Clone Repo
2. Upload both files (and any pictures) to Overleaf
3. Edit and update .tex file on Overleaf
4. Once you are done download the source from Overleaf
5. Commit new version of .tex here
6. Warning: To avoid merge conflicts make sure no one else is edting the .tex at the same time (there are 3 of us so that shouldn't be too hard)
